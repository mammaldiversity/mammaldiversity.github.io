Contributions to the site are welcome!

## Running the site locally

If you are contributing a change to the site, you are encouraged to run
the site locally to test your changes.

The site is served on GitHub Pages using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

To run locally:

- Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) using your operating system's
  tools. For example, on MacOS you may be able to use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
  and run `brew install ruby`.
- Install Jekyll and Minima: `gem install jekyll minima`.
- Figure out where the jekyll executable is stored. If you are using Homebrew, it
  may be something like `/opt/homebrew/lib/ruby/gems/3.3.0/bin/jekyll`.
- Run `jekyll serve` in this repository (or `/path/to/jekyll serve` if jekyll is 
  not on your `$PATH`)
- The site is now accessible at [localhost](http://127.0.0.1:4000/).
