# Updating the Mammal Diversity Database

This directory contains a recent copy of Mammal Diversity Database .

Please refer to data publication on Zenodo when re-using or citing the database.

When updating the file ```mdd.csv``` make sure to:

1. Keep the name the same and use git to manage versions (**recommended**: overwrite and commit a new version of ```mdd.csv``` . **not recommended**: add a new file with name ```mdd-final-master-copy-20April2021.csv``` )
2. Export the data as comma separated value using **UTF8** encoding (save without a BOM)
3. Ideally, you re-use an exact copy of an already published and citable csv file
